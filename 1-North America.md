This document refers to countries using the [North American Numbering Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan).

As such, Mexico is excluded and should be checked with its own page.

## What dialling does.

`011` is the international call prefix in the North American Numbering Plan.
As such, this becomes an international call.

Country codes are broken down by their first digit (zone). Zone 8 is East Asia
and special services (e.g. China is `+86` and satellite phones are `+881`).
`+89x` is an unused range classified as reserved for future use.

Therefore, dialling `0118 999 881 999 119 7253` from a North American phone
will result in an invalid number and likely a dropped call. This will,
however, vary by carrier.

# Testing

Google Voice does not allow dialling of this number or any number beginning with
`+89`, since it is not a valid country code.

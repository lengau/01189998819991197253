`0118` is the area code for dialling Reading.
Reading numbers are 7 digits, so this is equivalent to dialling
`(0118) 999-8819` and a series of extensions. International dialling
would be calling `+44-118-999-8819`.

Since `999` is a valid number for emergency services (along with the EU standard
`112`), a phone number starting with `999` is invalid in any area that doesn't
require area codes for local calling (including Reading).

Therefore, dialling the number should not connect.

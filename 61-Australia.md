# Australia

* Valid phone number: No
* Connects: No

## Destination

Australia has a trunk access code of 0. The area code 1 is reserved for
alternative phone systems (dial-up modems, TTY numbers, community service, etc.).
11 is for community service, but the 118 code is not currently reserved, and
your call will thus fail there.

Were this number to be activated, it would still probably be unavailable from
an international call, as community service numbers are not designed for
non-local use.

# Testing

Dialling from the US, Google Voice will allow the number but does not connect.

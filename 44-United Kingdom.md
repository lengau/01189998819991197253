## Destination

`0118` is the area code for dialling Reading.
Reading numbers are 7 digits, so this is equivalent to dialling
`(0118) 999-8819` and a series of extensions. International dialling
would be calling `+44-118-999-8819`.

Since `999` is a valid number for emergency services (along with the EU standard
`112`), a phone number starting with `999` is invalid in any area that doesn't
require area codes for local calling (including Reading).

Therefore, dialling the number should not connect.

## Overseas Territories

Many overseas territories of the UK do not share the UK's dialling plan and
should be checked individually.

### North American Numbering Plan
The following territories use the North American Numbering Plan and should be
checked in the NANP document:

* Anguilla
* Bermuda
* British Virgin Islands
* Cayman Islands
* Monserrat
* Turks and Caicos Islands

### Shared with other countries

The Pitcairn Islands share a country code with New Zealand and should use the
New Zealand page.

The British bases on Cyprus dial from Cyprus.

### Individual country codes

Other territories use their own country codes and should be looked up by their
own country code.

# Testing

## 2015-11-21: Tested by lengau

This test was made calling from a US number with Google Voice to
`+44-118-999-8819`

Google Voice allows the number to dial, but drops the call almost immediately.

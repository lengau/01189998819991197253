## Destination

`011` is the area code for the Johannesburg area. Because of this, dialling
`0118 999 881 999 119 7253` is equivalent to dialling `(011) 899-9881`.

An international caller wishing to dial this number could dial
`+27-11-899-9881`.

This number is currently (as of 2015-11-21) a disconnected number.

# Testing

## 2015-11-21: Tested by lengau

This testing was done from a Google Voice number in the US, using the
international calling number.

The number goes to a Telkom error message, which states
"The number you have dialled does not exist. Please redial carefully or consult
directory inquiries."
The message plays twice before disconnecting.

A recording of this error message is available in the recordings folder.

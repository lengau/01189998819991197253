## Destination

Like most countries, India has a trunk dialling prefix of `0`. In addition, it
has both 2-digit and 3-digit area codes. Area code `11` goes to New Delhi.
Given this, `0118 999 881 999 119 7253` can be converted into the Indian phone
number `011-89998819`. The first digit after the trunk code is an operator code,
of which only 2-6 are currently in service.

As such, it is not currently a valid phone number in India.

# Template

This file is a template for adding a dialling region. This section should
contain a list as follows:

* Valid phone number: (Yes/No)
* Connects: (Yes/No)

## Destination

This should be a brief explanation of where the number should dial. It should
include an explanation of how the number connects to its destination (if
applicable).

This may include a brief description of how phone numbers work in the country
in question. Explain it as if the reader is unfamiliar with phone numbers in
the given country.

# Testing

This section is for various tests done on these numbers.

## [Date]: Tested by [username]

If you have tested this dialling scenario, give a brief description here.
Your description should include:

* Whether the number connects
* Details of the phone called from (land line or mobile, preferably including
area code [if relevant])
* If an error message is played, the contents of the message. If possible,
a recording should be included as a separate file in this repository and
referred to from here. If the message is not in English, an English translation
is preferred.
* If the number calls a business or other public number, the name of the
business and its city location should be included.
* If the number is for a private residence (or otherwise should not be dialled,
such as a private office), note that the number should not be dialled as well
as the reason.

Please be considerate of time zones when dialling. It is possible that dialling
this number may call a private residence on the other side of the world (or in
your own neighbourhood). Make sure to research where this number *should* dial
before researching where it *does* dial.
